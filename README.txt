IDE and LIBRARIES used:
We used Pycharm as our Python Integrated Development (IDE) because of its familiarity
to us, different built-in developer tools, and supported libraries and packages. Most of the features
of our program used the Tkinter. Tkinter is the standard GUI library for python, and it offers wide
range of widgets to make executable GUIs. Some of the notable functions of Tkinter that we used
are scrolledtext, for printing eyestrain facts, and helpful eye care tips, messagebox for pop-up
reminders, and simpledialog for asking the nicknames of our users. We also used auxiliary
modules like the webbrowser module which directs the users to a google forms survey,
the datetime module to format Te Eyemo’s additional features, and pyttsx3 for text-to-speech
conversion.

HOW DOES IT WORK:
The features of our program that were mentioned earlier are 20-20-20 rule, desk exercise
reminder and water break reminder. The 20-20-20 rule means to look away every 20 minutes at an
object that is about 20 feet away for a full 20 seconds. It is beneficial to those users who have been
using their eyes for too long. So, how does the 20-20-20 rule work? Upon clicking its widget, the
timer will appear with 20 minutes time and will immediately start to countdown and when it
reaches zero, ‘yes’ or ‘no’ options will pop-up. If users clicked ‘no’, 20 seconds time will be given
to the users to look away at an object and this process will only repeat over and over again if they
keep choosing this option but if they clicked ‘yes’, then the program will just return to zero. Taking
frequent breaks to look at faraway objects during screen time significantly lessened the eye strain
symptoms. In other words, the 20-20-20 rule works. While many doctors suggest the 20-20-20 rule
is a best line of defense, researchers explain that any break from repetitive computer work or
screens is useful. Next, the desk exercise reminder, after a 50-minute countdown it will remind the
user to stretch and take a deep breath. Some health experts are increasingly warning that sitting for
prolonged periods of time has a negative effect on the body. Experts say it does not matter where
the sitting takes place, it’s the overall number of hours spent sitting that matters most. This exercise
reminder will reduce risk of musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs), like sprains and strains of the
lower back, shoulders, and knees. Will also reduce workplace stress and improved user
productivity. This ‘desk exercise reminder’ is based on pomodoro technique in which for every 50
minutes, users will take a break.
Many of us tend to forget drinking water during the work pressure. This habit can make us
dehydrated and cause many health issues. Our last feature in this program will be very helpful to
avoid such complications. This feature is the ‘water break reminder’, users just have to click its
widget then the timer will start to countdown. After 1 hour and 30 minutes, it will remind the users
to drink water. Drinking water will help increase energy and relieve fatigue. Since our brain is
mostly water, drinking will help us think and focus. Also, it will boost our energy levels to help us
work much better.
